Published in : Credit Risk Analysis of Peer to Peer Lending Based on the Logistic Regression Model and Classification Trees

Description : 'Finds the optimal classification tree using rpart and caret packages. To combat the class imbalance, 
prior probablities and resampling methods were applied. All classification trees were trained with the training set and evaluated
with the test set. AUC and several threshold metrics were used to evaluate the predictive capablitity.'

Keywords : 'Classification Trees, AUC, ROC, confusion matrix, F-metric, class imbalance, over-sampling. undersampling, 
prior probability'
